  Gatsby Shopify starter
</h1>

[![JamStackBox Status](https://jamstackbox.alexanderhoerl.de/badge/gatsby-shopify-starter)](https://github.com/AlexanderProd/jam-stack-box)

Kick off your next eCommerce experience with this Gatsby starter. It is based on the default Gatsby starter to be easily modifiable. [Demo](https://gatsby-shopify-starter.alexanderhoerl.de)

This starter also includes credentials to a Shopify demo store so you can try it out immediately without having to start a store. To use your own just change the values inside of `.env`.

If you have questions feel free to message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexanderhorl) ü§ôüèª

Checkout [nureineburg.netlify.app](https://nureineburg.netlify.app) for a real public shop built with this starter, the code is also [public](https://github.com/AlexanderProd/nureineburg.de/).  

## üíé Features

- Cart
- Product grid
- Product page
- Dynamic Inventory Checking
- Image optimization with Gatsby Image
- Styled Components with Emotion
- Google Analytics
- SEO

### üì¶ Dynamic Inventory Checking
The Shopify product inventory is being checked in realtime, therefore no rebuilding and redeploy is needed when a product goes out of stock. This avoids problems where products could still be available even though they're out of stock due to redeploy delay.

### üñå Styling
I'm using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) as styled components library, but the starter is purposely only sparsely styled so you don't have to remove unecessary code but can instead add your own styling immediately.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common problems

- You need to use the Shopify Storefront API credentials not the regular Shopify API.
- You need to have at least one published product on Shopify.

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using this starter
    gatsby new my-shopify-store https://github.com/AlexanderProd/gatsby-shopify-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-shopify-store/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-shopify-store` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1. **Connect your own Shopify store.**

    Open both `.env` files located in the root directory of your page end replace the credentials with your own. Don't forget to restart Gatsby for your store to be loaded!

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to use the Shopify storefront API credentials, not the regular Shopify API!
    
## Deploy

Checkout my other open-source project [JAMStackBox](https://github.com/AlexanderProd/jam-stack-box) to continuously deploy your Gatsby site on your own server.

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
